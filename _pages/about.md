I am an Assistant Professor in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/) at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/). My research focuses are in mathematical data science, optimization, and applied convex geometry. Before starting at HMC, I received my PhD in the Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Davis where I was advised by Professor Jes√∫s A. De Loera, and was a CAM Assistant Professor (post-doc) in the UCLA Mathematics Department where my mentor was Professor Deanna Needell.
